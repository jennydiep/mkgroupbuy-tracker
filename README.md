## Overview
For my final project I created a website that keeps track of mechanical keyboard group buy dates. For context, the mechanical keyboard community has a similar culture to sneakerheads where enthusiasts like to collect limited time/custom mechanical keyboards/keycaps. Group buys are usually run by community members where they design a product and open a time frame for consumers to purchase a spot in the group buy to gage interest and receive enough funds to manufacture their product.

The issue with group buys is there is no one specific place to post group buys except on the r/mechanicalkeyboards reddit which posts can get drowned by non group buy posts.
Therefore, the websiteâ€™s purpose is to track upcoming group buys and their time limits in a clean and consistent website where all information about certain group buys are clearly displayed.
